<p class="intro">Introducting the Stardust Tea: Sleepy Tea Collection. This collection is what sparked the inspiration for our brand. Stardust Tea was originally created with three signature tea blends including ingredients that have been used as natural remedies for treating insomnia. The brand name, Stardust, was inpired by the cosmic dust found between the stars - linking the imagery of a starry night with a good nights rest. This collection is very special to our hearts and we hope you love it is as much as we do.
